        WIP DON'T LOOK
        <!-- <p class="py-3">
            Hey! I'm Adrian, a tech enthusiast who loves to tinker and build cool stuff. I spend most of
            my days creating things, whether that's coding, YouTube videos, or game development. I'm all
            about making things that not only look good but feel great to use/consume.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Free time?</h2>
        <p class="py-3">
            When I give myself some free time, you can probably find me playing Dota 2. I run an
            educational YouTube channel where I dive deep into widely misunderstood and intersting
            mechanics.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning and teaching</h2>
        <p class="py-3">
            I'm always up for learning new things, whether it's a new programming language or a game
            development trick. I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner with a bit of a creative
            streak. If you're the same, let's chat about it! I love learning from others :)
