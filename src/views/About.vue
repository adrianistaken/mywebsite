                <p class="font-normal mb-3">I'm a software engineer, content creator, and gamer who loves building,
                    learning, and teaching. Whether it's coding useful and fun applications, creating in-depth
                    educational Dota 2 videos, or experimenting with new skills, I'm always working on something that
                    excites me.
                </p>
                <p class="font-normal">I enjoy solving problemsâ€”whether through software that enhances gameplay and
                    productivity or by
                    breaking down complex topics in a way that makes learning easy and engaging. My passion for
                    improving and sharing knowledge drives everything I do, from developing tools and apps to coaching
                    players and producing insightful content.
                </p>
                <p class="font-normal mt-3">If you're interested in gaming, software, or creative projects, you'll
                    probably
                    find something here
                    that resonates with you.
